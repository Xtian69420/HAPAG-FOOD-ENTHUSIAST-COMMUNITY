# HAPAG-FOOD-ENTHUSIAST-COMMUNITY
 Hapag is a mobile app designed for sharing and discovering Filipino recipes, much like Reddit but tailored to the culinary culture of the Philippines. Users can post recipes, tips, and cooking insights, creating an interactive space where the community can engage through likes, comments, and shares. It serves as a vibrant digital kitchen table, where food lovers connect over traditional and modern Filipino dishes, exchanging not only recipes but also the cultural stories behind them. With a community-driven approach, Hapag encourages users to contribute their favorite meals, try new ones, and discuss cooking techniques in a way that celebrates the diversity and richness of Filipino cuisine.
